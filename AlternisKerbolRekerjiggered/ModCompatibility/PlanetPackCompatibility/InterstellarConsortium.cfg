	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Kerbol^N
			%description = One of the brightest stars in the night sky. According to legend; Alternis, God of Change and Difference decided to smite the heck out of Kerbol, and this is what happened. It turns out that that legend has a bit of truth to it--aside from some differences, the Alternis Kerbol system is very similar in many respects to the Kerbol system. The similarity in the evolution of these two systems, despite their differences is truly remarkable, and by studying this system we can potentially learn a lot about the Kerbol system formed!

	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Moho]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Moho^N
			%description = The first planet in the Alternis Kerbol system but by no means the first discovered, Alternis Moho deserves its name, with a similar size and occupying a very similar orbit compared to Moho. Its somewhat lower and more eccentric may however give rise to increased volcanism!
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Eve]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Eve^N
			%description = The second planet orbiting Alternis Kerbol is fittingly known as Alternis Eve. Its orbit is a dead ringer for Eve's, though it is a fair bit smaller.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Jool]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Jool^N
			%description = The largest planet orbiting Alternis Kerbol is the system's sole large giant planet. It is remarkably like Jool in many ways, with a nearly identical mass and radius--equal to Jool's within error bars. Its three large moons are also remarkably similar to Jool's.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Minmus]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Minmus^N
			%description = It took until massive interferometric telescopes the size of Kerbin could be built, that the discovery of Alternis Pol was made possible--indirectly. Through closely monitoring the orbits of Alternis Laythe, Mun, and Kerbin, minute difference in those satellite's motions pointed to a tiny moon orbiting below Alternis Laythe. As of its discovery, it is Alternis Jool's smallest moon, and thus given the name Alternis Minmus.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Laythe]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Laythe^N
			%description = Alternis Jool's three large moons were initially discovered by transit, whenever Jool would cross the disk of Kerbol, more than one dip in the light curve would be seen. This indicated the presence of two large moons now called Alternis Laythe and Alternis Kerbin. Eventually, when telescopes powerful enough to detect spectral lines of the atmospheres of these moons were developed, oxygen was discovered, first on Alternis Kerbin and then on Alternis Laythe. Astrobiologists have speculated that if life arose on one satellite, impacts could carry the seeds of life to the other. These two satellites are rare and precious examples of extrakerbolar life, and a further investigation of these bodies is of utmost importance to any interstellar space program.

	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Mun]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Mun^N
			%description = Alternis Mun was one of the later moons to be discovered around Alternis Jool. With a smaller radius than Alternis Kerbin and Alternis Laythe, it took a lot longer to comb through transit data to confirm its existence. Despite being analogous to Vall in the orbital resonance arrangement and size, it is likely that this world is rocky in composition due to its proximity to the Sun.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Kerbin]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Kerbin^N
			%description = Although initially given the name Alternis Tylo, the discovery of an oxygenated atmosphere surrounding this habitable-zone world caused it to be recognized instead as a potential future home for Kerbalind. It is potentially one of only a handful of precious and rare worlds in the universe, those which not only support life, but might support Kerbal life as well.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Bop]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Bop^N
			%description = It took until massive interferometric space telescopes larger than the planet Kerbin were built before objects as tiny as Alternis Bop could be resolved. Very little about Alternis Bop is known, aside from the fact that it seems to orbit Alternis Kerbin, and the mild spectral similarities between it and Bop.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Pol]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Pol^N
			%description = It took until massive interferometric telescopes the size of Kerbin could be built, that the discovery of Alternis Pol was made possible--indirectly. Through closely monitoring the orbits of Alternis Laythe, Mun, and Kerbin, minute difference in those satellite's motions pointed to a tiny moon--large by asteroid standards--orbiting Alternis Jool beyond Alternis Kerbin.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Tylo]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Tylo^N
			%description = The second planet around Alternis Kerbol to be discovered and the fourth in terms of distance, Alternis Tylo lies a bit beyond where Duna would orbit in the Kerbol system. It is a super-Kerbin-mass object, nearly 14 times the mass of Kerbin. Its actual discovery predates the naming of objects after Kerbol system bodies, and was originally called "Stumbos." It was only officially given Alternis Kerbol nomenclature once transit data ruled out the presence of a thick atmosphere around the body. Given that the unlikelihood of a body like this having a thick hydrogen/helium envelope was comparable to the unlikelihood of Tylo possessing an atmosphere, the Kerbal Astronomical Union named this body "Alternis Tylo."
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Dres]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Dres^N
			%description = Using complex machine learning algorithms and decades of transit data from the Alternis Kerbol system, the HELIX super-computer was able to conclusively prove the existence of fifty-five satellites surrounding Alternis Tylo. Graduate students were then able to conclusively disprove all but two of them. The small rocky Alternis Dres was the innermost of the two.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Duna]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Duna^N
			%description = Using complex machine learning algorithms and decades of transit data from the Alternis Kerbol system, the HELIX super-computer was able to conclusively prove the existence of fifty-five satellites surrounding Alternis Tylo. Graduate students were then able to conclusively disprove all but two of them. The largest of the two had the same radius as Duna, and given the similar orbit around the Sun, the Kerbal Astronomical Union settled on Alternis Duna for the name.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Gilly]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Gilly^N
			%description = Alternis Gilly was discovered first during a transit of Alternis Eve observed by high resolution interferometric telescopes. Initially thought to be a newly discovered satellite and given the tentative name Alternis Gilly, spectroscopic data suggested that the body was in fact made of volatile ices that were being outgassed into space. The object turned out to be a comet, but it would be another few decades before the body's existence and period could be confirmed.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Eeloo]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Eeloo^N
			%description = Alternis Eeloo was the last planet to be discovered orbiting Alternis Kerbol. Its great distance from its star meant that it took a long time to orbit, and there had been very long times between transits. Its presumed icy composition and distant orbit grant it its title of Alternis Eeloo.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Vall]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Vall^N
			%description = The Very Large Starshield Telescope placed in Kerbolar orbit was able to directly image Alternis Eeloo as it completed its laps around Alternis Kerbol. Through repeated measurements of Eeloo, a periodic wobble was discovered, caused by a somewhat small moon. The only moon in the system cold enough to be icy in composition, the Kerbal Astronomical Society named it "Alternis Vall."
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[AKR/Ike]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Alternis Ike^N
			%description = The sun-orbiting Very Large Starshield Telescope was able to catalog several extrakerbolar comets by blocking out the light of the star and watching for dim regions of outgassing. Discovered first vaguely nearby Alternis Tylo and Duna, this particular comet was only observed once and given the name Alternis Ike.

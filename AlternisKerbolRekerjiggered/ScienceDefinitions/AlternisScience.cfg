		LaytheSrfLandedVolcanoes = The ground rumbles. You start to feel you should probably get out of here before the ground explodes.
		
		LaytheInSpace = You have to double take to make sure you're not looking at Kerbin.

		VallSrfLanded = The surface occasionally rumbles beneath you. You think you should probably get back to the ship.

		TyloSrfLanded = The gravity here is crushingly intense. You struggle to remain standing in the threateningly powerful gravity. You try as hard as you can not to fall down, because you wouldn't be getting back up any time soon.

		default = You poke at the ground looking for some really cool rocks to take home.

		KerbinSrfLanded = Yep. Looks like dirt with bits of grass in it.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = You've taken a sample of the water. It appears to dramatically increase the surface humidity of anything it touches.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The surface is charred and coated with burnt rocket propellant. There are also trace amounts of a conspicuous green substance.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The surface appears to be very hard, like concrete. It might actually be concrete. Could be a very good surface to land at.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This substance is what makes the scientists yell at us when we go into the labs without cleaning our boots first.

		MunSrfLanded = The surface appears to be a fine dust with a grey-ish tone. The sample contains a combination of breccia and melted materials.
		
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface seems to consist of tiny crystal-like grains, very pretty. Probably not edible.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You resist the urge to sneak a taste of the surface sample. Mission Control assures you that, for the eleventh time, Minmus is absolutely not cinnamon.

		EveSrfLanded = The surface appears to have a distinct yellow tint to it. Not just a pale brown, but actually yellow. It's not just you, right?

		DunaSrfLanded = This surface consists of a grainy, very fine sand-like dust, and it appears to be getting everywhere.
		DunaSrfLanded = There appears to be traces of water in the soil!

		LaytheSrfLanded = You attempt to catch one of the insects--or maybe they are rodents--and, after failing, you settle for a sample of grass.
		LaytheSrfLanded = A particular flower reminds you very much of an ancient species of flower on Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = As you collect a jar of the water, you notice some small motes wobbling around. One of the motes seems to have consumed another!
		LaytheSrfSplashedCraterLake = This particular lake seems to contain a high amount of salt. Only through a microscope could any life be seen.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = A very small fish of some kind swims into the sample jar. Amazed at your luck, you quickly cover the sample container jar and ask Mission Control about having a fish bowl in the command module.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You catch a long piece of purple-green seaweed. The purple recedes back into the water, leaving a brown-green piece.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = When you go to pick up another sample of seaweed, the seaweed turns out to be some kind of long, snakelike fish. It glows white, and your space suit life support electronics suddenly begins sparking and turns off. Good thing this planet has a breathable atmosphere.

		VallSrfLanded = You chip away the frozen surface and deposit some of the browinsh surface into a container.

		TyloSrfLandedFrost = The ground gives way easily but the surface underneath is much harder.

		TyloSrfLandedCanyons = The ground here is brittle, which doesn't put much faith in the looming cliffs around you.
		TyloSrfLandedLowlands = The relatively dense atmosphere in Tylo's lowlands seems to be related to a slightly higher oxygen concentration in these regions. Did Tylo once have life?
		TyloSrfLandedRock = The hard, tough rock is nearly impenetrable by your tools.
		TyloSrfLandedDirt = There are some surprisingly complex structures in some of the dirt samples. Fossils or just the biproducts of chemical reactions? You reflect upon how similar those two possibilities really are, and look up into the sky to try to find Jool and your home.
		TyloSrfLandedDirt = The jagged regolith sticks to your suit. This could be a problem.
		TyloSrfLandedGagarinCrater = There are signs of a recent impact here. This site could be as young as 18 million years old!

		BopSrfLanded = The grey-brown dust stains all the parts of your suit that it comes in contact with. This is apparently quite amusing to flight control.
		BopSrfLanded = An uncomfortable writhing feeling in your mind prevents you from digging too deep. The surface layers of regolith will have to do.

		PolSrfLanded = As you shovel the contents into a container, you can't help but feel you'll be allergic to whatever it is.
		PolSrfLandedLumps = The greyer material comprising the massive lumps appears to be much denser.
		PolSrfLandedLowlands = The sample analysis of the red fluff suggests a partial composition of organic molecules, including amino acids!
		PolSrfLandedMidlands = The yellow-orange regions of Pol are colored by deposits of sulfur in the fluffy silicate regolith.
		PolSrfLandedHighlands = The greyer regions seem to be home to some salts and minerals unfamiliar to Kerbin.
		PolSrfLandedPeaks = The grey peaks of Pol seem to be coated in tenuous levels of frost. Fascinating!
		PolSrfLanded = After conducting samples of the surface, you determine with a high certainty, that Pol, is not in fact made of Pollen. This will cause quite the stir back home!

		EelooSrfLanded = Chipping away at the icy surface, you find some brown soil underneath.		
		EelooSrfLanded = You find a beautiful crystal and place it in the sample container.
		EelooSrfLanded = The rocks contain thin whisps of color. They remind you of lovely ion engine exhaust trails...

		TyloInSpace = The computer gave an odd report no matter how many times we sent the request. Open the sample bay doors... "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that" was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.
		
		BopSrfLanded = The samples appear to be having a chemical reaction with the surface of Bop.
		BopSrfLanded = All of the liquid samples instantly evaporate.

		PolSrfLanded = Some of the samples pit and melt when they come in contact with the surface of Pol!

		DresSrfLanded = The sensor measures the local gravity in fine detail and records all variations. You're slightly confused as to why the instrument isn't quite pointing downward, until you remember that you're orbiting the massive Tylo.

		JoolInSpace = The sensor calibrates to measure the massive gravitational forces of Jool.
		JoolInSpace = The sensor picks up a wealth of information about our local planetary system.

		PolSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere to speak of. But you sample the atmosphere anyway.

		EelooSrfLanded = There appears to be a tenuous atmospheric coating around the planet. However, it is too thin to affect any spacecraft landing here.

		MunSrfLanded = You save the Mun from yet another crater.
		
		TyloSrfLanded = You just managed to get a giant space rock all the way to the surface of the largest, hardest to land on, rocky planet in the solar system. You deserve a break.

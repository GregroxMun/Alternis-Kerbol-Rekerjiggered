		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Sun
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You can't help but notice how awfully yellow the planet is.
				SrfLanded = The "Overheating" light blinks on and off. You should really get that lightbulb fixed.
				SrfSplashed = The spacecraft seems to be stuck in some... kind of... tar?
				InSpacePlateau = Wow, look at that.
				SrfLandedPlateau = Temperature... nominal. Pressure... nominal.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You watch the flowing blue-white storms below, they seem to go on forever endlessly swirling into each other.
				InSpace = Jool, the sky ball. The really big one. Now it's even bigger-er. You feel an almost spiritually blissful feeling. Then you realize that's just because you accidentally injected yourself with your emergency morphine.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The darker red lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
				InSpace = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood candy. You are tempted to taste the surface, even though you know it would burn your tongue.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin, you wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
				InSpace = The surface is colored green, no doubt by vegetation.
				SrfLanded = There is a small flicker of burning grass under your ship, perhaps there's a rocket fuel leak.
				SrfLanded = Are those... maple trees? OH GOD NO THEY'RE NOT.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = The snow around the craft melts on contact with the warm spacecraft exterior.
				SrfLandedSouthernMountains = The snow around the craft melts on contact with the warm spacecraft exterior. The ground beneath the spacecraft sinks into the muddy soil.
				SrfSplashed = Your craft bobs up and down in the water. You see a strand of seaweed float past.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Mun
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
				InSpace = You look at the surface of the Mun and try to find a good landing space. The inside of the craters might be the best option.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
				SrfLandedRunway = Reporting in at the Runway. Good thing there's not a lot of air traffic, because I don't think we ever got clearance from the tower to be here.
				SrfLandedKSC = This is our Space Center here. We're home.
				Flying = Hey I can see my house from here, I think.
				InSpaceLow = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky seems to be mostly below us.
				FlyingLowGrasslands = Hey, I can see my house from here, I think.
				FlyingLowGrasslands = It's very comforting to see that much green below you.
				FlyingLowHighlands = You get a great view of the highlands.
				FlyingLowMountains = The mountains rise up from the ground of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from way up here.
				FlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
				FlyingLowBadlands = This looks like a bad place to land.
				FlyingLowTundra = You see patches of frozen grass. It looks like it's pretty cold out there.
				FlyingLowIceCaps = = You look down and see a sheet of shining white ice. If you stare at it too long your eyes start to water.
				FlyingLowShores = The shores look inviting and you watch the waves roll in to the coast.
				FlyingLowWater = From this perspective you can see the underwater topography.
				InSpaceLow = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky seems to be mostly below us.
				InSpaceLow = Maybe if you get out and push...
				InSpace = It's very... round.
				InSpace = Crew reporting in, from space!

		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Bop
			Values
			{
				InSpace = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
				InSpace = As you stare at the object, something flits by the window.. Is there something moving down there?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Pol
			Values
			{
				InSpace = It looks vaguely like a really large grain of pollen. You note down -Pol- in your report.
				InSpace = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				InSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. There are a few fjords that look like they would be terrifying to fall off of.
				InSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of brown and yellow. Perhaps there is a significant amount of gold down there?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Dres
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The planet is pale brown in color. You check the box on your report labeled "Desert, not Dessert"
				SrfLanded = We've landed on the surface of Duna. Internal heaters... active.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Gilly
			Values
			{
				InSpace = It looks like a particularly lumpy dirty snowball. You bet you could you could jetpack down there.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eeloo
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
				InSpace = You search the sky for other nearby planets, you think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe we should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Vall
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The surface has many impressive and jagged mountain ranges. You don't think you'd like to try and land on them.
				InSpace = The moon is mostly white and dark red-brown shades. It looks very cold and possibly frozen.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Ike
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You can't help but like Ike for discovering this comet.
				InSpace = There appears to be some steep rocky slopes. Some of the slopes are coated white, while others are charcoal-grey.
				InSpace = Isaac's Comet is a particularly jagged and pointy object, but the gravity might make that a moot point.

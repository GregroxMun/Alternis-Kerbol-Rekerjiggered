	{
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Sun
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = Everything is melting, including the electronicsssss.........
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The materials bay bakes in the heat of Moho's surface. It appears that trace elements are reacting to the samples contained within.
				SrfLanded = You expose the samples to the high temperatures of Moho. A lot of them melt in really interesting ways.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The crushing pressure of the atmosphere is causing some of the materials to crystallize rapidly.
				SrfSplashed = The materials melt in the tar.
				FlyingHigh = The extremely dense atomsphere strips the contents of the materials bay.
				FlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to either polish, or strip the material, depending on its composition.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sample computer scans the results, and attempts to play chess with some of the samples.		
				FlyingHigh = The intense crushing pressure has drastically changed the composition of the materials. Super heating and abalation effects have been observed. The science bay is looking very disgruntled.
				FlyingLow = The samples burn, boil or crumple under the extreme pressures and heat. The visual camera shows a wonderful rainbow of colors before it cuts out.
				SrfLanded = You're not sure where the container stops and the samples start anymore...
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = While the material samples were processed, you began to turn your thoughts to how much Minmus looks like a cinamon candy, and have discovered that you are now hungry.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = One of the samples burns on contact with the atmosphere. Interestingly, the color indicates the presence of oxygen.
				FlyingLow = The sample smolders and pops as it burns up.
				SrfLanded = An amphibian--or perhaps it's an insect--sticks its proboscis into a nutrient-rich sample.
				SrfSplashed = The sample bay power supply begins to short out! Electricity arcs and etches into the samples of the bay. It's quite the display!
				SrfSplashed = The sample bay power turns on. A long, eel-like fish swims into the bay and does unspeakable things to the samples.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Mun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The fine dust of the Mun has intermixed with some of the samples. You have a sneaking suspicion that they'll never be able to get the lab clean again.
				SrfLanded = You leave the sample bay doors open on the Mun, and go do something else for a while.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The materials show little signs of change. Though one of the samples appears to be judging you silently.
				FlyingLow = The less resiliant samples appear to have splattered around the interior, forming new and interesting color combinations.
				FlyingHigh = The rarified air has caused interesting changes to Gel samples. It seems like something is happening with the interior structure.
				InSpaceLow = The micro gravity has greatly affected the growth of crystalline structures. Loose objects are also flying around the bay in a very messy but fascinating way. 
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Bop
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The samples appear to be having a chemical reaction with the surface of Bop.
				SrfLanded = All of the liquid samples instantly evaporate.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Pol
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Some of the samples pit and melt when they come in contact with the surface of Pol!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Some of the samples shatter under the continuous high gee forces. 
				InSpace = The computer gave an odd report no matter how many times we sent the request. Open the sample bay doors... "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that" was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Dres
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = As the samples process, the computer asks if it can sing you a song while it works. Apparently it's about a flower of some kind.
				SrfLanded = One of the samples evaporates when exposed the environment.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Opening the sample container you find that everything has turned yellow. Initial tests show that it'll never wash out of white space suits. You consider sending missions in yellow EVA suits to reduce cleaning costs.
				SrfLanded = The sample computer processes the results. It's massive red eye seems to be at home here as it slowly, ominously, blinks.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Gilly
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The samples appear to behave like they're in low orbit of Kerbin.
				SrfLanded = Some of the surface material has mixed with the contents of the bay. You write down the results for good measure.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eeloo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Some of the fine crystals lining Eeloo enter the materials bay. It appears that some of the samples have become more conductive in the extreme cold.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Vall
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Many of the samples freeze or evaporate from the sample container.
				SrfLanded = The sample container door freezes up, before continuing to open. A thin coating forms on the surface of the samples.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Ike
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = One of the samples has reacted very strangely to the surface of Ike.
				SrfLanded = One of the crystal samples explodes and throws green shards out of the materials bay!
			}

	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Sun
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The temperature is extremely high here. Many of the spacecraft's vital systems are overheating.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The dark surface rocks hold a lot of heat. Contact with the surface heats the thermometer.
				SrfLandedEugeniosOrofice = The higher regions of the volcano are, strangely enough, the coolest parts of this very hot planet.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Temperatures range between boiling and super-boiling.
				SrfLandedPlateau = Temperatures here are... temperate.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The temperature increases with depth, so it's really hot down here.
				FlyingHigh = The temperature is cool here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Minmus is rather warm, so it definitely isn't ice.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Temperature readings are surprisingly nominal. Only a bit warmer than Kerbin.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = It's just cold enough to freeze water solid.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Mun
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Temperature readings are, quite literally, nominal.
				SrfLandedDeserts = Large plumes of heat are rising from the surface of the desert.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid.
				SrfLandedShores = Just the right temperature to go for a swim.
				SrfLandedWater = The water appears to get colder as the depth increases.
				SrfLandedTundra = It's cold enough to keep things permanently frozen here.
				SrfLandedGrasslands = The temperature here is quite pleasant, and would be a nice place to live.
				SrfBadlands = the temperature appears to fluctuate here a good bit depending on the time of day.

		Body

			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The atmospheric pressure is extremely low here, and the density is even lower--the pressure is raised significantly by the great temperature of Moho.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The atmospheric pressure is very high even at this altitude.
				SrfLanded = The atmosphere is very dense at the surface. It crushes down on the instrumentation.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The pressures here are immense, the instrument is beginning to fail.
				FlyingHigh = The pressures are very high, it seems dangerous to probe any deeper.
				SrfLanded = Either the pressure is really high, or the instrument just melted. It's hard to tell what happened first.
			}
		}
		
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = There is definitely an atmosphere, pressures are fairly nominal.
				SrfLanded = The pressures here seem to be a bit below that of Kerbin. Definitely at a manageable level.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The atmosphere pressure decreases rapidly with altitude, so it's no wonder it's hard to slow down.
				SrfLanded = The atmosphere is considerably thinner than Kerbin's.
				SrfLandedHighlands = At these heights, the air is so thin it might as well not even be here.
				SrfLandedLowlands = The atmosphere seems to have pooled in the lower regions of Tylo, because here the atmosphere approaches half of Kerbin's.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The atmosphere is very thin here, but it is enough to register on the instrumentation.
				SrfLanded = The atmosphere is pretty thin even at the surface. You don't think parachutes or wings would work very well here.
			}

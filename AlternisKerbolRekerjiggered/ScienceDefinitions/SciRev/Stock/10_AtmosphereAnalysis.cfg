			Values

		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				Flying = The atmosphere is not thick enough to get a good reading.
				Srf = The atmosphere is not thick enough to get a good reading.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				Flying = This might be an atmosphere, but it's definitely not something you want to breathe. The majority of Nitrogen shares a composition with Sulfur Dioxide and small amounts of, strangely enough, oxygen. Traces of organic gasses as well.
				Srf = This might be an atmosphere, but it's definitely not something you want to breathe. The majority of Nitrogen shares a composition with Sulfur Dioxide and small amounts of, strangely enough, oxygen. Traces of organic gasses as well.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The atmospheric pressures are very high here, and you detect a large number of gasses.
				FlyingHigh = The atmosphere is a composition of Hydrogen, Helium, and Nitrogen, in that order. The upper atmosphere has the primary amount of Hydrogen and Helium, while Nitrogen levels increase further down.
				FlyingLow = The instrument is having trouble sampling at these densities.
				SrfLanded = The instrument has mostly compressed into an unrecognizable mass of metal.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The atmosphere on Laythe appears to be very similar to that of Kerbin. Nitrogen, Oxygen, and traces of Carbon Dioxide.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = The sensor picks up volcanic ash amongst the nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.
				SrfLanded = The instrument detects organic molecules amidst the nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. You are reminded of Pol as you futily attempt to stop a sneeze.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = It seems there is very little atmosphere at these altitudes. Make sure you're properly suited up if you plan on going outside.
				SrfLanded = Temperature and Pressure readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any. Kerbin's atmosphere is Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Carbon Dioxide. But we already knew that.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				Flying = The atmosphere is largely nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Trace levels of argon and oxygen.
				Srf = The atmosphere is largely nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Trace levels of argon and oxygen.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values
			{
				Flying = The atmosphere on Duna is very, very thin. It might be possible to fly in it with large enough wings or a fast enough aircraft.
				Srf = There appears to be a larger concentration of heavy isotopes in the atmosphere then on Kerbin.

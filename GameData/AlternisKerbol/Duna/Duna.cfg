			description = Duna is a small, butterscotch-colored moon orbiting Tylo, and was the first moon discovered orbiting a planet other than Jool. This discovery was vital to prove that Jool was not the center of the universe, because after all, if something was going around Tylo, it wasn't going around Jool. Its brown-yellow color is thought to be due to a sandy, nutrient poor soil covering. Its tenuous atmosphere is likely heavy in carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and very very thin. Duna has some small dry-ice and water ice caps, which may hold the potential for simple forms of life. Comparing to Laythe's lush environment and contrasting with Eve's toxic atmosphere, Duna is thought to be the third best planet in the Solar System for supporting life. For this reason, Duna has long been a wonder to Kerbalkind.

			description	= Eeloo is a large dirty snowball planet orbiting in the outskirts of the Kerbol system. It is very difficult to see from the Joolean system because of how far away it is. Some Kerbals have petty arguments about its status as a proper planet, but they must surely be confused. Eeloo is plenty large enough. Maybe even TOO large. It's not like it hasn't cleared its orbit or anything. If it hadn't then that would be another story entirely. Eeloo was the very first planet to be discovered instead of being known since antiquity.

			%description = Coolgi is a large ice world on the outskirts of the Alternis system. It is essentially a large dirty snowball. There must be life here to, because there's definitely canals. Although come to think of it, it is doubtful that any life could survive that far from the sun. Maybe the canals are just cracks.

			description	= The Mun is a medium-sized satellite orbiting Jool. It is mostly grey in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. It took an embarassingly long time to discover the Mun. It was finally discovered when someone decided to jot down the location of the silver object in the sky that was so hard to look away from. It was discovered to be a moon, and then aptly named Mun.

			%description = Galeo is a small moon orbiting Meander. It is grey and telescope observations suggest it is heavily cratered. It is possible, however unlikely, that the grey areas are in fact seas. This is not likely to be the case. The moon is named after the scientist who discovered the moons of Jool: Galeo Kerman.

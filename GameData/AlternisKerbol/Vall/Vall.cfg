			description	= Vall is a small hunk of ice orbiting a large dirty snowball. The gravitational stresses between the two objects likely caused cryovolcansim in the past. It was first discovered when scientists realized that an object as large as Eeloo should not be wobbling at all. They decided to take another look at Eeloo, and sure enough, there was Vall.

	@Body[Sun]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The Sun is the most well known object in the daytime sky. It's a gigantic nuclear furnace, fusing hydrogen into helium to produce the energy needed. The sun is so hot that everything on it is plasma. Copper, iron, aluminium and many others. It's large too--around a million Kerbins could fit inside. It's also very far away. About 8.4 million miles away. (That's why it looks so small)
		}
	}
	@Body[Moho]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Moho figures in Kerbal mythology as a fiery place with oceans of flowing lava. In reality however, it’s much less interesting. \n\nScientists speculate about possible ways Moho could actually be as hellish as mythology places it: some ideas leading directly into new and exciting aerospace advances.
		}
	}
	@Body[Eve]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Eve is certainly the brightest extrajoolean planet in the sky. Slightly larger than Kerbin, it's often considered Kerbin and Laythe's long lost sister world. \n\nUnlike Kerbin and Laythe, Eve is considerably hotter, and is likely to have an unbreathable atmosphere. When viewed through a telescope, the planet's gorgeous ring can be seen, thought to be composed of dust and dirt from a moon that Eve once had.

	}
	@Body[Jool]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Jool is the largest planet in the solar system and certainly the largest object in Kerbin's skies. Despite this, it was actually discovered fairly late in Kerbal history, as Kerbalkind originated on the far side of Kerbin. It is a swirling blue-white planet made out of the gasses hydrogen and helium, just like the Sun!
		}
	}
	@Body[Minmus]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Minmus translates into ancient Kerbal as "Smallest Member," as it was thought to be the smallest member of the Jool system. It is the reddest object in the solar system.
		}
	}
	@Body[Laythe]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Long known as Kerbin's sister moon, Laythe was seeded with life hundreds of millions of years ago when a large asteroid struck Kerbin - catapulting boulders with various life forms into orbit around Jool. Given its proximity to Kerbin, some of this impact debris found its way to Laythe, depositing a precious cargo of microbes and, according to some theories, whole plant seeds. This life quickly spread across the moon, until it became the lush green world we know today. (There are, however, fringe theorists who believe that life started on Laythe and was brought to Kerbin, but that's just absurd)

	}
	@Body[Mun]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The Mun is a medium-sized satellite orbiting Jool. It is mostly grey in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. The Mun, along with Laythe, were described by the ancient Kerbals as "Horizon Wanderers," as they were on the far side of Kerbin and could not see Jool.
		}
	}
	@Body[Kerbin]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = 	A very nearly unique world, Kerbin has flat plains, soaring mountains and wide, blue oceans. The only world which may rival it is Laythe. Home to the Kerbals, Kerbin has just the right conditions to support a vast, seemingly undepletable population of the eager green creatures. \n\nReaching a stable orbit around Kerbin is one of the first things budding space programs strive for. It is said that those who can get their ship into orbit are halfway to anywhere.
		}
	}
	@Body[Pol]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Pol is a very unique object orbiting Jool. Its comparatively low density suggests that it is a rubble pile, a bundle of rocks that happen to be flying in the same orbit, held together by what is probably fair to say is a mildly disinterested sort of gravity. It was thought to be a distant planet like Eve or Tylo since antiquity because it was so small in the sky. It was only after someone tried to calculate the orbit of Pol around the sun that they realized it was really going around Jool this whole time. Its surface is a strange muddle of yellows and browns, all in a very confusing and mysterious unknown composition. No one has ever been able to figure out for certain what the darned surface is made of. Three separate studies returned totally different planet-wide surface compositions, ranging from stony to icy to organic. The only way to tell for sure what the surface is made from would be to retrieve a sample directly.
		}
	}
	@Body[Tylo]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Tylo is an insanely massive so-called "Superkerbin" planet, the fourth away from the Sun. It is thought to be the core of a failed gas giant like Jool, made from rock and ice. Some have suspected that Tylo may support intelligent life of some strange sort on its crushing surface. However, because of the high escape velocity of the planet, astronomers agree that the chances of anything coming from Tylo are over a million to one. Its atmosphere is so thin that it won't slow you down, but it is so thick that it will burn you up on re-entry. Some Kerbals have even suggested that landing on Tylo is impossible, let alone returning. For this reason, Tylo has won the spaceflight engineer's award for "Most Hated Planet and/or Moon." The Kerbal Astronomical Society claims to give three golden stars to the first kerbal to make the return trip.

	}
	@Body[Dres]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Dres is a medium sized moon orbiting Tylo. The moon is dark grey with a few spots dotting its lumpy surface. It was notorious among astronomy students and professors alike for being "The most boring thing in the entire sky." Indeed, the Kerbal Astronomical Union came to the same conclusion, and hastily reclassified the moon as a moonlet. Not much is known about its structure or composition because nobody really cares.
		}
	}
	@Body[Duna]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Duna is a large desert world orbiting Tylo, and was the first moon discovered orbiting a planet other than Jool. Its brown-yellow color is thought to be the result of a dry, dirty surface poor in nutrients. Its atmosphere is unlikely to support life, though the prospect of a habitable underground network has enticed science fiction authors for decades.
		}
	}
	@Body[Gilly]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Gillian's Comet, "Gilly," is a small comet orbiting The Sun. Every few years it flies by the sun, melting and outgassing its dark, icy surface into the void. It was named after the first astronomer to derive its orbit: Gillian Kerman.
		}
	}
	@Body[Eeloo]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Eeloo is the most distant planet in the solar system. Likely made of ice and rock, the planet has had no atmosphere yet detected. It was the first planet and thus far only planet to be discovered from scratch, as opposed to being known of by the ancients. \n\nSpaceflight engineers have proposed the use of atomic energies such as fission to generate power so far away from the sun. Underneath the icy crust of Eeloo may be a vast ocean of liquid water, making it the third most potentially habitable planet or moon in the solar system.
		}
	}
	@Body[Vall]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Vall is a small moon orbiting Eeloo at a very close distance. Its tidal interaction with its parent planet may have given rise to cryovolcanism on both bodies. When Vall was first discovered it was thought to be almost as massive as Eeloo, and thus the system was classified as a double planet system.  After it was discovered that Vall was smaller than expected they had to reconsider whether or not it really should be called a planet or not. While the majority of the scientific community agreed that it should be classified as a moon instead, a very vocal minority insisted that "poor Vall" was indeed a planet. On good days, this argument would result in petty name calling, and on bad days it would result in all-out brawls. In the end, the Kerbal Astronomical Union reclassified Vall as a moon. This is a decision that has made a lot of people unhappy and has been widely regarded as a "bad move."

	@Body[Ike]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Isaac's Comet ("Ike"), whose orbit was first derived by Isaac Kerman, is a large icy comet orbiting the Sun. Its orbital period is much longer than Gilly's, and only through careful examination of cometary sightings over many years was Isaac Kerman able to piece together a valid trajectory. When he accurately predicted the appearance of the comet the following year, the comet was aptly named after him.

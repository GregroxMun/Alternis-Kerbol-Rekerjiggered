			description	= Eeloo is a medium-sized, snowy ice-ball on the edge of the solar system. It was the first sun-orbiting planet to be discovered as opposed to being known to the ancients. It is made from ice and dirt and is expected to potentially harbor a thin atmosphere. As the most distant planet in the solar system, it receives very little heat and light from the sun. Spaceflight engineers have proposed the use of atomic energies such as fission to generate power so far away from the sun. Underneath the icy crust of Eeloo may be a vast ocean of liquid water, making it the fourth most potentially habitable planet or moon in the solar system.

			%description = Coolgi is a large ice world on the outskirts of the Alternis system. It is essentially a large dirty snowball. There must be life here to, because there's definitely canals. Although come to think of it, it is doubtful that any life could survive that far from the sun. Maybe the canals are just cracks.

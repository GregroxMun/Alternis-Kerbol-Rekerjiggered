			description	= Vall is a small moon orbiting Eeloo at a very close distance. Its tidal interaction with its parent planet may have given rise to cryovolcanism on both bodies. When Vall was first discovered it was thought to be almost as massive as Eeloo, and thus the system was classified as a double planet system.  After it was discovered that Vall was smaller than expected they had to reconsider whether or not it really should be called a planet or not. While the majority of the scientific community agreed that it should be classified as a moon instead, a very vocal minority insisted that "poor Vall" was indeed a planet. On good days, this argument would result in petty name calling, and on bad days it would result in all-out brawls. In the end, the Kerbal Astronomical Union reclassified Vall as a moon. This is a decision that has made a lot of people unhappy and has been widely regarded as a "bad move."

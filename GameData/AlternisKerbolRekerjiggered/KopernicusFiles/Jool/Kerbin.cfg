			description = Kerbin is a large moon orbiting Jool with tall mountains, rolling green plains, sandy brown deserts, and wide blue seas. It was long thought that Kerbin is the home of all known life, including the Kerbals. The conditions of the surface of Kerbin seem to support a vast and seemingly undepletable population of the eager and foresight-lacking creatures. Reaching an orbit around Kerbin is considered a major achievement. As the saying goes: "Once you're in orbit around Kerbin, you're halfway to anywhere!"

			%description = Kibren is a large moon orbiting on the outer orbit of the Laplace resonant orbit of the Meanderian moons. It is blue-green and has an oxygen atmosphere, which means it very likely has life. Whether it has a space program with little blue men running around flying things into space for science is a different question entirely.

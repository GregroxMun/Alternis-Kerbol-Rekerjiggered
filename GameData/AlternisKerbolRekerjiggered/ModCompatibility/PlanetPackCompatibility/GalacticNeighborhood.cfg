{
	@Body[Sun]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description =  The brightest star in the rather dim constellation Alterno, Alpha Alternis is a K0 Yellow Dwarf main sequence star. Its name turns out to be an apt comparison, as Alpha Alternis is very much like an alternate version of our own solar system. Both systems have similarly sized stars and single gas giants, but unlike Jool, Jwel is in the star's habitable zone. Alpha Alternis is the only star in the constellation Alterno, as the rest of the stars have aptly and self-destructively changed which constellation they belong to.

	@Body[Moho]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The first planet in the Alpha Alternis system, Zubol is a hotter planet than it should be, suggesting it's still got an active interior.
		}
	}
	@Body[Eve]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Evidence from transit observations suggests that either Stiv is incredibly oddly shaped, or it may have a ring system.
		}
	}
	@Body[Jool]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Jwel is the largest planet in the Alphae Alternis system, It lies in the habitable zone and has at least three moons, which seem to mirror Jool's moons in mass and orbits.
		}
	}
	@Body[Minmus]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Cinmus is a hypothetical exomoon that would orbit Jwel. It was proposed to explain differences in Edner's expected position. The differences were probably just a manifestation of false precision, but Cinmus may be a real moon after all...
		}
	}
	@Body[Laythe]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Edner is one of the three confirmed moons of Jwel. A tiny amount of oxygen absorption was detected in Alpha Alternis' light emission during a Jwel transit, and only Edner and Kermun are massive enough to hold onto these sorts of atmospheres.
		}
	}
	@Body[Mun]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Lon is the second of the three confirmed moons of Jwel. It is the smallest of the three.
		}
	}
	@Body[Kerbin]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Kermun is the third of the three confirmed moons of Jwel. It is one of two candidates to explain the small amount of oxygen absorption present in Alternis' light emission during a Jwel transit. It is the more likely candidate given its mass, distance from the parent planet, and detection vs timing.
		}
	}
	@Body[Bop]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Mip was a spurious object detected near Kermun during a transit. It is now thought to have been instrument error.
		}

	@Body[Pol]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Pic was a spurious object detected during a transit. It is now thought to have been instrument error.
		}
	}
	@Body[Tylo]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Stumbos is an insanely massive so-called "Superkerbin" planet, the fourth away from Alpha Alternis. It is thought to be the core of a failed gas giant, made from rock and ice. Oddly enough, despite very clear atmospheric detection from Jwel as well as other system's superkerbin planets, no atmosphere has been positively identified on Stumbos, earning it the title of "Super-Tylo". The Kerbal Astronomical Society claims to give five golden stars to the first kerbal to make the return trip through interstellar space.

	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Havert was entered into the records as a prank by astronomical society grad students. Havert does not actually exist.
		}
	}
	@Body[Duna]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Aegar was the first positive detection of an exomoon around a solid terrestrial planet, and over several years enough observations granted an estimation of the moon's period and distance. This was used to calculate the incredible mass of Stumbos. 
		}
	}
	@Body[Gilly]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Gilley's Comet was the first comet discovered around another star, discovered by the Gilley Deep Space Observatory in Ave, Cobbsland.

	@Body[Eeloo]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Dagroth is the furthest known planet in the Alpha Alternis System.

		@Properties
		{
			%description = Muntin is Dagroth's moon / binary companion.

	@Body[Ike]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Isaac's Comet was a false measurement of Gilley's Comet that was thought to be a separate body.

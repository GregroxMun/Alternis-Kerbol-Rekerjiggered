				SrfLanded = It's getting very hot out here... 
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The gravity, at least, is comfortable. Temperature and atmosphere... not so much.
				SrfSplashed = Swimming in thick, goey tar pits isn't your idea of fun or survival.
				SrfLanded = You hope the suit's refrigeration holds.
				SrfLandedPlateau = You could breathe here, if it weren't for the poison gas and lack of oxygen in the air. But at least you wouldn't puff up or get crushed to death.
				InSpaceLowPlateau = Wow, look at that. That mountain appears to be above the bulk of the atmosphere.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You're not sure how you even landed on the surface of a gas giant. But it's probably best not to think about it for too long.
				FlyingLow = You reflect on the many religion and cult members that would give anything to be where you are, as you transmit your last will and testament.
				FlyingHigh = This is a dreadful idea, but it is pretty at least.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You feel a bit like a super hero when you jump in the low gravity.
				SrfLanded = You stare up at the sky, looking for Jool. It's really big in the sky.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This place seems nice, you're so comfortable you feel like taking your helmet off. You check the box on your report for -Looks breathable-.
				SrfLanded = You take off your helmet, and breathe in the warm smells of flowers and grass. You check the box on your report for -Actually Breathable-.
				SrfLanded = You sniff a flower only to have it spray some kind of spikes at your face. That's going to hurt. You check the box on your report for  -Hazardous Life-.
				SrfLanded = Are those maple trees? OH GOD NO THEY'RE NOT NO THEY'RE REALLY REALLY NOT!
				SrfLandedSouthernMountains = You ponder making a snow angel. The ground is too hard for that though.
				SrfLandedNorthernMountains = You ponder making a snow angel. You settle for a snowball fight with a tree.
				SrfLandedNorthernMounains = Wow. Laythe has some really environment-resistant trees.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = Really? There's actual trees here too? Laythe trees are kinda badS. You check to box on your report for -lampshade a LandControl bug-. Mission control won't respond to your inquiry of what exactly that means.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = Your space suit is keeping you nice and cozy, but without it you'd really need a blanket or a towel or something to keep from freezing.
				SrfLandedEquatorialLand = Without your space suit on, you imagine it would be very humid and hot. Luckily your space suit is keeping you nice and cool.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = The ground rumbles. You start to feel you should probably get out of here before the ground explodes.
				InSpace = You have to double take to make sure you're not looking at Kerbin.

				MunSrfLanded = You look up and search the sky for Kerbin. Oh, there it is! No wait, maybe that was Laythe?
				MunSrfLanded = You start to say something dramatic and poignant about the plight of Kerbal-kind in this grand universe, only to be cut off by random radio chatter that the situation is nominal.
				MunInSpaceLow = Is this really a good idea? Staring at the cratered surface below, you're beginning to wonder...
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = This is a most precarious situation.
				FlyingHigh = You're starting to feel you should really get back into the ship.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Bop
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface is brown and grey and very lumpy. You poke at it with your glove and notice how hard it is.

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Pol

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Each step threatens to break every bone in your body. Well it would, if you had any bones left from the landing.
				FlyingLow = You're too distracted by your eminent crash to write a report.
				FlyingHigh = A fall from a few kilometers might be survivable in a space suit, if you were on Kerbin! Good luck, and rest in peace.
			}

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Dres
			Values

		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = After much testing, you determine that sand castles are plausible.
				SrfLanded = Everywhere you look, you see dunes and sand.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = Rolling plains of dry ice, what a site.
				SrfLanded = You're not sure, but you could swear you're being pulled toward Tylo. Probably not.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Gilly
			Values

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eeloo
			Values

		Body

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Ike
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The massive slopes behave much the same as the flat areas, wherever they can be found. Isaac's Comet's Gravity is tiny.
				SrfLanded = There's a bunch of large rocks scattered around the surface. The surface appears to react oddly to light.

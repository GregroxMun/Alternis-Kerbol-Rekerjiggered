	@RESULTS
	{
		default = The goo seems to flutter in and out of reality, occasionally turning a color which doesn't quite fit the situation.
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Sun
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The Goo seems to be almost boiling. It writhes around the canister.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The Goo has become rubbery and bounces around the container.
				InSpace = The Goo takes on a yellow-green coloration. Is it just the lighting, or did it change color?
				SrfLanded = The Goo begins bubbling.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The Goo takes a bluish tint, and swirls into several spirals which then spread apart into white spheres, before recoagulating.
				InSpace = You swear the goo zapped into a bright green color for a moment.
				InSpace = The goo takes on an intriguing optical property. Whenever it moves between Jool and the observation camera, Jool becomes green! This warrants further examination.
			}

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo attempts to wiggle its way out of the container. Some of it flows off and seeps into the ground. A small patch of grass around the goo turns brown and the goo grows in size.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = The goo catches on fire.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = The goo freezes into several transparent spheres.
				SrfLandedSouthernMountains = The goo drips out of the container and freezes into ice-sickles.
				SrfLandedNorthernMountains = The goo flows out of the container, turns grey, and produces a hard, spiky outer shell.
				SrfLanded = The goo escapes out of the canister and starts flowing right toward a small, distinctly rodent-like flower. The goo encompasses the plant, and all that is left is a strange skeleton.

		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Mun
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The Goo seems to be less dense here.
				Srf = The Goo seems to be less dense here.

		Body
		{

			Values
			{
				SrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo doesn't seem to be doing much right now.
				SrfLandedRunway = The Goo seems to behave very much the same as it always does around here.
				SrfLandedDeserts = The Goo seems to hate it here.
				SrfSplashedWater = The Goo escapes into the water!
				SrfSplashedShores = The Goo wobbles around in its container and starts to seep out of the holes.
				SrfLandedShores = The Goo accumulates near the water facing side of the container.
				SrfLandedKSC = The Goo seems bored.
				FlyingLow = The Goo jiggles and wobbles as the craft flies.
				FlyingHigh = The Goo seems to be getting very cold now.
				InSpaceLow = The Goo seems to have clumped into a sphere. It also appears to have become brittle.

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Pol
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Gooey tentacles reach out of the canister, freeze, and break off. Fascinating!

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo has pooled into a perfectly flat puddle along the bottom of the container.
				InSpace = The goo seems to resist movement more. It didn't gain mass, did it?

			name = AKR/Dres
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values

				InSpace = The Goo separates into small butterscotch discs. You want to eat them, but you know the scientists at KSC wouldn't approve.

			Values
			{
				InSpace = While observing the canister, you feel as though something is looking back at you from the shadows of the container.
				InSpace = The instruments suddenly read off the charts for a moment! The container flexes outwards and then settles.

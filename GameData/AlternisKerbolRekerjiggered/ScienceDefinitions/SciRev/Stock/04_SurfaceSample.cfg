		Body

			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface appears to have a distinct yellow tint to it. Not just a pale brown, but actually yellow. It's not just you, right?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface seems to consist of tiny crystal-like grains, very pretty. Probably not edible.
				SrfLanded = You resist the urge to sneak a taste of the surface sample. Mission Control assures you that, for the eleventh time, Minmus is absolutely not cinnamon.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = The top-most sample is comprised of snow. Deeper samples seem to yield solid lava.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = Underneath a layer of snow is a layer of basalt, rocks with lots of popping air bubbles in them.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = You're not sure if the white stuff is snow, ash, or both.
				SrfLandedSouthernMountains = The sample is mostly dirty snow with a little bit of moss in it.
				SrfLandedNorthernMountains = A small insect seems to be shivering in the cold. You capture it in the container, and make sure to remember to turn the sample heater on back in the ship.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = The sample is fluffy snow with a hard ice crust beneath it.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = Some of the rock is still warm as you put it into the sample container.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = There's a small amount of moss on the side of some rocks.
				SrfLandedImpactCrater = While the life is more or less the same as other places on the planet, the soil contains different isotopes than the rest of the planet. The exact composition is strangely similar to the composition of Kerbin's crust.
				SrfLanded = You pick up a neat looking alien flower and deposit it into a sample container.  You make sure to punch a hole in the top of the container.
				SrfLanded = You attempt to catch one of the insects--or maybe they are rodents--and, after failing, you settle for a sample of grass.
				SrfLanded = A particular flower reminds you very much of an ancient species of flower on Kerbin.
				SrfSplashed = As you collect a jar of the water, you notice some small motes wobbling around. One of the motes seems to have consumed another!
				SrfSplashedCraterLake = This particular lake seems to contain a high amount of salt. Only through a microscope could any life be seen.
				SrfSplashed = A very small fish of some kind swims into the sample jar. Amazed at your luck, you quickly cover the sample container jar and ask Mission Control about having a fish bowl in the command module.
				SrfSplashed = You catch a long piece of purple-green seaweed. The purple recedes back into the water, leaving a brown-green piece.
				SrfSplashed = When you go to pick up another sample of seaweed, the seaweed turns out to be some kind of long, snakelike fish. It glows white, and your space suit life support electronics suddenly begins sparking and turns off. Good thing this planet has a breathable atmosphere.

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Mun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface appears to be a fine dust with a grey-ish tone. The sample contains a combination of breccia and melted materials.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				KerbinSrfLanded = Yep. Looks like dirt with bits of grass in it.
				SrfSplashed = You've taken a sample of the water. It appears to dramatically increase the surface humidity of anything it touches.
				SrfLandedLaunchPad = The surface is charred and coated with burnt rocket propellant. There are also trace amounts of a conspicuous green substance.
				SrfLandedRunway = The surface appears to be very hard, like concrete. It might actually be concrete. Could be a very good surface to land at.
				SrfLandedKSC = This substance is what makes the scientists yell at us when we go into the labs without cleaning our boots first.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Bop
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The grey-brown dust stains all the parts of your suit that it comes in contact with. This is apparently quite amusing to flight control.
				SrfLanded = An uncomfortable writhing feeling in your mind prevents you from digging too deep. The surface layers of regolith will have to do.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Pol
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = As you shovel the contents into a container, you can't help but feel you'll be allergic to whatever it is.
				SrfLandedLumps = The greyer material comprising the massive lumps appears to be much denser.
				SrfLandedLowlands = The sample analysis of the red fluff suggests a partial composition of organic molecules, including amino acids!
				SrfLandedMidlands = The yellow-orange regions of Pol are colored by deposits of sulfur in the fluffy silicate regolith.
				SrfLandedHighlands = The greyer regions seem to be home to some salts and minerals unfamiliar to Kerbin.
				SrfLandedPeaks = The grey peaks of Pol seem to be coated in tenuous levels of frost. Fascinating!
				SrfLanded = After conducting samples of the surface, you determine with a high certainty, that Pol, is not in fact made of Pollen. This will cause quite the stir back home!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedFrost = The ground gives way easily but the surface underneath is much harder.
				SrfLandedFrost = The ice in the sample darkens when exposed to your heated space suit mittens. It melts into mud, and you try to collect another ice sample--this time with your glove heater off.
				SrfLandedCanyons = The ground here is brittle, which doesn't put much faith in the looming cliffs around you.
				SrfLandedLowlands = The relatively dense atmosphere in Tylo's lowlands seems to be related to a slightly higher oxygen concentration in these regions. Did Tylo once have life?
				SrfLandedRock = The hard, tough rock is nearly impenetrable by your tools.
				SrfLandedDirt = There are some surprisingly complex structures in some of the dirt samples. Fossils or just the biproducts of chemical reactions? You reflect upon how similar those two possibilities really are, and look up into the sky to try to find Jool and your home.
				SrfLandedDirt = The jagged regolith sticks to your suit. This could be a problem.
				SrfLandedGagarinCrater = There are signs of a recent impact here. This site could be as young as 18 million years old!
				SrfLandedSouthPolarBasin = The rocks are covered by permafrost of CO2 and Water ice.
				SrfLanded = You hum a little tune while you work to make the time pass faster. Tylo has some really interesting rocks!
				SrfLanded = You've decided that carrying the sample jar around counts as weight lifting. Granite isn't the heaviest of minerals, but it's doing you no favors.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Dres
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You find traces of a large number of elements. Likely deposited here by impacts over time.
				SrfLanded = After digging around for a bit you find some nice bits of glass and throw them in your sample container.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This surface consists of a grainy, very fine sand-like dust, and it appears to be getting everywhere.
				SrfLanded = There appears to be traces of water in the soil!
				SrfLandedIceCaps = Dry ice with traces of water ice line the soil.
				SrfLanded = Unable to satisfy your curiosity, you attempt to drill into the rock with your tool. You're thinking it would be a lot easier if you had some kind of pulsating drill thing on a robotic arm.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Gilly
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface gives away easily and you have a hard time keeping the sample in the container due to the low gravity. 
				SrfLanded = The composition of elements is very similar to that of an asteroid.
				SrfLanded = The material is somewhat volatile. Some of it vaporizes when you expose it to the sunlight.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eeloo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Chipping away at the icy surface, you find some brown soil underneath.		
				SrfLanded = You find a beautiful crystal and place it in the sample container.
				SrfLanded = The rocks contain thin whisps of color. They remind you of lovely ion engine exhaust trails...
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Vall
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You chip away the frozen surface and deposit some of the browinsh surface into a container.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Ike
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedDarkRegions = The Dark black soil has an almost crystalline structure. It's fun to play with.
				SrfLandedLightRegions = The white soil has a powdery texture and clumps together.
			}

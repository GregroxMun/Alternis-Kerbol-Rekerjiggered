		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Sun
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor detects vibrations deep inside the planet. It appears that the interior is very volcanically active.
				SrfLanded = Odd reflections are detected in the recorded vibrations. This might tell us more about the interior structure.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor has detected possible seismic activity below the surface.
				SrfLanded = The vibrations, though slight might be enough to map the interior structure of the planet.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor doesn't even know what to do with itself here.
				SrfLanded = The sensor has informed you that the warranty has just been voided. No refunds.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Faint seismic waves are detected.
				SrfLanded = Sounds of shifting and vibration are detected under the surface. It is possible that the interior is not completely solid.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The tidal forces appear to be churning the interior of the moon.
				SrfLanded = Vibrations under the surface indicate current geological activity.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = There is a small spike in the ambient vibrations when you notice a little nearby vent expel some gas.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Mun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor has detected a quake in the surface!
				SrfLanded = The sensor picks up distant impacts on the surface reflecting along the interior of the Mun.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Bop
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = There does not appear to be any major seismic activity on Bop.
				SrfLanded = A seismic event is detected in the distance. As if a large object had just impacted the surface.
				SrfLanded = There are strange phantom forces on the accelerometer.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Pol
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The loose soil transits vibration differently than on other bodies.
				SrfLanded = Vibrations reflect off the hollow structures inside the moon.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The planet suffers from momentary shakes due to seismic activity. There could be radioactive decay heating in Tylo's core.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Dres
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This planet appears to be seismically inactive. 
				SrfLanded = periodic bombardments appear to be causing slight vibrations and surface quakes.
				SrfLanded = Changes in the speed of vibrations hint to differing materials under the surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor gives insight to the seismic activity of Duna.
				SrfLanded = There does not appear to be significant seismic activity on the planet. It is possible that it is no longer geologically active.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Gilly
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface rumbles with every step you take. You worry that the tiny comet might fall apart beneath you.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eeloo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Cryovolcanic activity is detected in the interior of the planet.
				SrfLanded = The sensor picks up low frequency sounds.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Vall
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Sensors detect signs of cryovolcanism along the surface.
				SrfLanded = The sensor picks up vibrations reflecting around the interior of the moon.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Ike
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface is surprisingly stable, but periodic sprays of ice into the void remind you how volatile comets are.
			}

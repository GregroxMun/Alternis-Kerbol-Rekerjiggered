		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor passes over the terrain of Moho surverying for variances in the gravitational field.
				SrfLanded = Landing here has provided a very accurate and stable measure of gravitational forces.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor records slight variances as in gravity as you pass over a massive crater site.
				SrfLanded = The gravitational field is somewhat strong here. The sensor records detailed data about the local field.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor calibrates to measure the massive gravitational forces of Jool.
				InSpace = The sensor picks up a wealth of information about our local planetary system.
				SrfLanded = Before the instrument was crushed by the massive pressures and temperatures, the instrument read "4/5 Gee." Very nearly Kerbin gravity. This of course means very little, as gas planets don't have actual surfaces. Science!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Passing over the surface of Minmus the sensor sweeps across the gravitational field of Minmus.
				SrfLanded = The sensor takes detailed readings of the local gravity on Minmus.
				SrfLanded = The scan picks up the subtle changes in field caused by the orbit of Laythe. This data will provide valuable insight into our local planetary system.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Laythe
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor scans the gravity of Laythe. It helps hint at the diverse terrain under the water.
				SrfLanded = The Sensor scans the local gravity of Laythe, recording the influence of Jool.
				SrfSplashed = The sensor provides detailed gravity information in relation to the tides.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Mun
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The instrument surveys for changes in the field of the Mun. This data will help to accurately calculate the mass of the body.
				SrfLanded = The sensor conducts a detailed survey of the local gravity. 
				SrfLanded = After calibration the sensor is able to detect the interplay of gravity between Kerbin, Laythe, Minmus, and the Mun.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor finds subtle changes in the gravity field of Kerbin. The science team will want to see these readings!
				SrfLanded = The sensor seems to think it's being calibrated.
				SrfLanded = After reading the manual a few times, the command team is able to take an accurate reading of the local gravity.
				SrfSplashedWater = The sensor has detected changes in the local gravity that seem to be related to the passing of the Moons.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Bop
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Orbiting Bop allows for scans of the varied surface. Interesting stuff!
				SrfLanded = The sensor is giving odd readings here...
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Pol
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor must be set to maximum sensitivity to sense anything from Pol. It seems to be showing complex subsurface structure, with dense lobes surrounded by porous regions of fluff.
				SrfLanded = Landing on the planet has allowed for highly detailed scans of the interior gravity on Pol. The moon seems to be comprised of several small lumps held together by a distinerested sort of gravity and a signifcant amount of fluffy dust. The sensor has mapped several regions where Pol appears to be almost hollow!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The planet's gravity nearly crushes the gravimeter. You make a note of the forces in your notebook as you force-reboot the gravimeter.
				InSpace = The planet has much higher gravity than it has any right to have. This will give our scientists information about the interior makeup of Tylo.
				SrfLanded =	Detailed scans have hinted to hollow spaces in the interior of the crust. They may very well collapse eventually under the extreme gravity and form new canyons.
				InSpace = The surface is surprisingly uneven gravitationally, with patches of dense regions in the highlands.
				InSpace = The interior layers of the planet are mapped: It appears to be an extremely dense inner core with a massive outer iron core with a thin mantle. This would explain the planet's extreme density.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Dres
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor sweeps the surface and finds the average gravitational pull to be quite low for a large moon.
				SrfLanded = The sensor measures the local gravity in fine detail and records all variations. You're slightly confused as to why the instrument isn't quite pointing downward, until you remember that you're orbiting the massive Tylo.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Duna
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor passes over the mottled surface of Duna. Gravity appears lowest in the massive canyon that stretches across the surface.
				SrfLanded = The sensor performs a detailed and calibrated sweep of local gravity on Duna.
				SrfLanded = The sensor is primarily registering the gravitation of Tylo, even from the surface of Duna. The sensor must be broken, because Duna isn't.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Gilly
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor picks up the fluctuations in the gravity of this lumpy body.
				SrfLanded = The team back at KSC will enjoy these detailed readings.
				InSpace = The sensor registers a small chunk of rock being spit out.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eeloo
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Though the surface appears to be smooth, there are fluctuations under the surface of the planet.	
				SrfLanded = The "down" arrow on the gravimeter does not seem to point perfectly down, but rather slightly toward Vall.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Vall
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Scanning from orbit provides a clearer picture of the internal makeup of Vall.
				SrfLanded =	Scanning on the surface details gravitational fluctuations in the shifting interior of the planet.

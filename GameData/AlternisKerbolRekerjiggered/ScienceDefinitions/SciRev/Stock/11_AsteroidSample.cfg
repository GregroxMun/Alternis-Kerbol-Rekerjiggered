		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You feel a little bad about the prospect of moving one of Jool's little moons out of place just for science. For all you know this asteroid may have been a god to some ancient tribe thousands of years ago.
				Flying = The rock ablates away, leaving only a metal shield behind. The rock heats up. Not a particularly great heatshield after all.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Minmus
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The asteroid has crushed a bit of the surface. You have a sinking feeling as you realize the ground is not stable

			Values

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Mun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You save the Mun from yet another crater.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = One part of the asteroid is fairly hard. So hard you can't use your pick to collect a sample. You check the box on your report for -Metallic Composition-.
				InSpaceHigh = You feel like some kind of hero deflecting this asteroid. It would be rather embarrassing if the asteroid hit Kerbin from here.
				InSpaceLow = The sample of the asteroid crumbles in your hands as you attempt to keep it in the collection jar. Low gravity is tough to work with.
				Flying = You collect a sample of the asteroid while screaming through the air in what will no doubt be regarded as an extremely badS manuever.
				SrfLanded = You just landed a space rock from space on Kerbin. You find it difficult to pay attention to your work after doing that.
				FlyingHigh = You collect some of the rock as it crumbles off of the asteroid. You really ought to get back in the ship. 
				FlyingLow = Some rock crumbles off of the asteroid. A bit of gaseous ore steams out of the asteroid.
				SrfSplashed = The asteroid slowly sinks down, and some parts of the rock dissolve into the sea.

		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Bop
			Values
			{
				InSpace = As you fight the feelings of existential dread, you knock off a few more rocks.

		{
			name = AKR/Pol
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Tylo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You just managed to get a giant space rock all the way to the surface of the largest, hardest to land on, rocky planet in the solar system. You deserve a break.
				SrfLanded = The dense rock is difficult to hold. You drop the sample just a half a foot, but the sample container shatters.
				SrfLanded = Your rock pick is prohibitively heavy. You manage to knock a rock off of the asteroid, but a tiny pebble falls on your head. You might have a severe concussion now.

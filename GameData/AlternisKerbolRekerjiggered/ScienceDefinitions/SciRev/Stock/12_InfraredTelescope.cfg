	{
		default = You point the telescope out into space, scanning for celestial bodies.
		default = Surveyed 12 red dwarf stars for transiting planets. Two new exoplanets discovered.
		default = Surveyed the sky for planemos, discovered a brown dwarf star.
		default = Surveyed the sky for planemos, discovered a binary rogue planet.
		default = Surveyed the sky for transiting planets. Three new exoplanets discovered.
		default = Surveyed the sky for transiting planets. No stars surveyed had transit candidates.
		default = Detected supernova in a distant galaxy.
		default = Surveyed the sky for planemos. No regions surveyed contained thermally luminous planemos.
		default = Surveyed the sky for eclipsing binary stars. Detected 1 red-dwarf double star and one large transiting planet.
		default = Surveyed the Alternis Kerbol system for new minor planets. Detected 3 minor planet candidates.
		default = Surveyed the Alternis Kerbol system for new minor planets. Detected no new minor planets.
		default = Surveyed the Alternis Kerbol system for new minor planets. Detected one new minor planet candidate.
		default = Surveyed the sky for Deep Sky Objects. Detected a Planetary Nebula, which, by the way, and I'm breaking the fourth wall here, have nothing to do with planets. William Herschel, who discovered Uranus, named those nebulae Planetary Nebulae because their blue color and circular shape reminded him of Uranus.
		default = Surveyed the sky for Deep Sky Objects. Detected an attractive double star in an open cluster.
		default = Surveyed the sky for Deep Sky Objects. Detected a globular cluster.
		default = Surveyed the sky for Deep Sky Objects. Detected a fantastic double open cluter.
		default = Surveyed the sky for Deep Sky Objects. Imaged the Great Southern Globular Cluster in high detail.
		default = Surveyed the sky for Deep Sky Objects. Imaged the Great Spiral Galaxy in the North in high detail.
		SrfLanded = You point the telescope into the sky, searching for something interesting. Alas, the telescope does not track, so all the images appear streaked.
		Flying = This telescope is not designed for atmospheric flight. You have voided the warranty. If you would like to purchase a flight-capable telescope, contact Sophia in the aerospace research department.
		
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Sun
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The telescope is too warm to function correctly, and if exposed to the light it would burn out the sensor.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Moho
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The telescope is too warm to function correctly.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Eve
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The telescope maps the thermal hotspots in Eve's clouds.
				InSpaceLowPlateau = A plateau sticks out of Eve's clouds. It appears to be relatively cool.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Jool
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The telescope maps out the hot and cool bands of Jool. The giant swirly spot appears to be particularly warm.

			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Kerbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You point the telescope at Jool, before realizing that Kerbin's atmosphere is too warm for the sensor. There's always public night at the observatory!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = AKR/Bop
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The camera sensor is picking up faint gaseous tendrils glowing in the infrared. Without the sensor even being engaged with the telescope.

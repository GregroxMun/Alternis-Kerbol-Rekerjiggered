	//How To Use Settings
	
	//dude it's like, case sensitive, m8.
	//so you gotta like, type True not true or TRUE
	//or False not false or FALSE.*
	//so just keep that in mind a'ight?
	
	
	//*OK, technically anything that's not "True" will be counted as "False."
	//You could use "Banana" and it would mean the same thing as False.
	
	//BigOrbitsNoMoonletBop:
	//This setting will make the Alternis!Joolean system look and feel more like a realistic system.
	//It is *almost* compatible with Principia, except for the orbits of Bop and Pol.
	//Note: it is NOT ACTUALLY compatible with Principia.
	//All orbits have been rescaled to 2.6x, and Jool has been given a much larger mass.
	//You *can NOT* use Moonlet Bop with this version.
	//You can use principiaCompatibleOrbits = True to have Moonlet Bop with the larger Jool and larger moon orbits.
	
	//MoonletBop:
	//PuTs BoP iNtO aN oRbIt ArOuNd KeRbiN iNsTeAd oF jOoL.
	//In real life, this configuration is actually *more stable* than where Bop normally would be.
	
	//PrincipiaCompatibleOrbits:
	//MoonletBop must be enabled as well.
	//Jool is made much more massive and a little larger!
	//Orbits are made 2.6 times further out, but with some minor differences to make it stable in Principia, the N-body mod.
	//Just thought I'd warn you.
	//note: Since I can't seem to put Bop in a stable orbit with Principia, you actually have to use Moonlet Bop
	//if you actually want to use principia. It's more stable.
	
	//EveRings:
	//Rings are decorative and have no shadows. That's the only reason they're not in by default.
	
	
	//GregSux = True
	
	
	//do not edit below this point. There's some important coding stuff down here that you can't mess with.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	//Since you're here, how about a poem I wrote about the stock KSP version of Minmus?
	
	//Minmus isn't pudding.
	//Minmus aint Ice Cream.
	//Minmus aint a pistachio, and it certainly aint bleu cheese.
	//Minmus is a comet, that flew by planet Eve.
	//And was captured in 'round Kerbin
	//to orbit eternaly.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	//Also I lied about important coding stuff.

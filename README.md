# Alternis-Kerbol-Rekerjiggered
A mod for Kerbal Space Program that reorganizes the solar system's planets. Actually, it's the reboot of the mod, after the original dev (NovaSilisko) stopped developing.

Now actually compatible with Kopernicus 1.0.5!

**Alternis--the God of Change and Difference--decided to smite the heck out of the Kerbal's home solar system. This is what happened.**

NOTE: DELETE ALL CACHES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS IN Gamedata/Kopernicus/Cache BEFORE INSTALLING A NEW VERSION.

Alternis Kerbol Rekerjiggered is the (properly done) rerelease of the classic, wonderful, and beautiful v0.23 mod for KSP: **Alternis Kerbol.** 
It grabs and re-arranges the solar system bodies to create something new. Almost all bodies have been changed somehow, 
be it in a large way or a small way. Two objects are even comets.

This mod requires the Kopernicus Plugin to function.

The mod also includes PlanetShine and DistantObject configs. You must install those mods first, then overwrite their configs.

There's also redone science definitions available. To use them you must backup your stock config and replace it. It is in GameData/Squad/Resources/ScienceDefs.cfg

Alternis Kerbol was originally created by NovaSilisko for Kerbal Space program version 0.23. All of the art assets belong to him. Everything in the mod is based off of what NovaSilisko developed.

The most important gameplay change of Alternis Kerbol is that** Kerbin orbits the gas planet Jool**, along with several other moons.
This means that it can be easier to fly to neighboring bodies such as Mun, Laythe, Minmus, Bop, and Pol.

Here's the **list of changes**, as true as possible to the original Alternis Kerbol mod.

* Jool: Moved to Kerbin's original orbital position, blu-ified.
* Kerbin: Now orbits Jool at the same point Tylo used to.
* Laythe: Redone entirely, now a jungle moon with varied terrain, more land, and, eventually, trees. (Panspermia's a heckuva thing.)
* Minmus: Orbits Jool beneath Laythe, now 29km in radius (from 60), and deep reddish orange.
* Tylo: orbits the sun a bit past Duna's original orbit, radius increased to 1103 km and surface gravity is 4g, plus an atmosphere 50% the density of Kerbin's.
* Duna: Orbits Tylo, completely new terrain.
* Moho: Orbit moved inward and made more eccentric.
* Gilly: Small comet, shrunk to 8.5km radius.
* Ike: Fat comet, shrunk to 17.5km radius.
* Mun: Relocated to Jool orbit, replacing Vall. Enlarged to 253 km radius.
* Vall: Now orbits Eeloo, shrunk to 99.8 km radius.
* Eeloo: Moved outward, increased to ~500 km radius, less eccentric and inclined orbit.
* Dres: First moon of Tylo.
* Lighting: Ambient light now nonexistent in space, dimmer on planet surfaces. Sun is slightly reddish-yellow and casts a harsh, warmer light.
* Atmosphere: Colors have been modified to simulate the lighting from the warmer sun.
* Sun: Shrunk to 7500 km and gravity increased so that the planets move at the right velocity.
* General: Most orbits have at least some inclination and eccentricity now, as opposed to being perfect circles like the Kerbin system.

**To-Do list for the Future**

* Add trees to Laythe
* Biomes for altered celestial bodies. (Basic versions already implemented)
* change sun's surface color.
* Make Bop a moon of Kerbin as an optional version.

**Known Problems**

* Timewarp limits have not been changed from stock. I use Warp-Unlocker which removes the altitude limits for timewarp. Recommend you do the same.
* Minmus' craters at the Flats level are below "sea" level, so they have lighting/camera bugs. Original Alternis also had this issue.
* The KSC view is often bugged when Kerbin is reparented (Sun-->Jool) and there is nothing that can be done about it. Flight view and all editors are fine.*
* *except rarely when it isn't. Don't timewarp in the space center view. If you do get the jagged terrain bug, revert to VAB and relaunch.

**Thanks To**

* NovaSilisko, without whom none of this is possible at all. I mean, like, not even the stock system would be possible when you think about it.
* Thomas P. and others, for developing and maintaining Kopernicus.
* Thomas P., Sigma88, KillAshley, and NathanKell, for helping me with my really newbish mistakes early on and my really dumb mistakes later.

# Alternis-Kerbol-Rekerjiggered
A mod for Kerbal Space Program that reorganizes the solar system's planets. Actually, it's the reboot of the mod, after the original dev (NovaSilisko) stopped developing.


Here's the list of changes, as true as possible to the original Alternis Kerbol mod.

* Jool: Moved to Kerbin's original orbital position, blu-ified.
* Kerbin: Now orbits Jool at the same point Tylo used to.
* Laythe: Redone entirely, now a jungle moon with varied terrain, more land, and, eventually, trees. (Panspermia's a heckuva thing.)
* Minmus: Orbits Jool beneath Laythe, now 29km in radius (from 60), and deep reddish orange.
* Tylo: orbits the sun a bit past Duna's original orbit, radius increased to 1103 km and surface gravity is 4g, plus an atmosphere 50% the density of Kerbin's.
* Duna: Orbits Tylo, completely new terrain.
* Moho: Orbit moved inward and made more eccentric.
* Gilly: Small comet, shrunk to 8.5km radius.
* Ike: Fat comet, shrunk to 17.5km radius.
* Mun: Relocated to Jool orbit, replacing Vall. Enlarged to 253 km radius.
* Vall: Now orbits Eeloo, shrunk to 99.8 km radius.
* Eeloo: Moved outward, increased to ~500 km radius, less eccentric and inclined orbit.
* Dres: First moon of Tylo.
* Lighting: Ambient light now nonexistent in space, dimmer on planet surfaces. Sun is slightly reddish-yellow and casts a harsh, warmer light.
* Atmosphere: Colors have been modified to simulate the lighting from the warmer sun.
* Sun: Shrunk to 7500 km and gravity increased so that the planets move at the right velocity.
* General: Most orbits have at least some inclination and eccentricity now, as opposed to being perfect circles like the Kerbin system.
